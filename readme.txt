== Description ==

- Consent-free tracking: Scoby Analytics is fully compliant with GDPR and ePrivacy, so you do not require user consent for measurement.
- Comprehensive analytics: Scoby Analytics captures essential metrics like page views, visitors, time on site, referrers, and session duration.
- High-level data security: Our company and data centers are based in Germany, ensuring top-notch data protection standards.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why choose Scoby Analytics? =
Scoby Analytics is your privacy-friendly alternative to traditional analytics tools. We collect anonymized website usage data without accessing your visitors' devices, eliminating the need for cookie consent.

= Can Scoby Analytics measure conversions? =
Yes. You can measure conversions by setting Goals within Scoby. Goals are typically associated with specific URL patterns. All conversions are aggregated into a single metric.

= Can Scoby Analytics measure soft conversions? =
Scoby's server-side analytics don't support rule-based conversions traditionally measured on the client side. However, we're open to discuss your specific requirements for implementing suitable goals.

= Does Scoby Analytics enable visitor segmentation? =
Yes, you can segment your visitors based on anonymous traits like "Women", "35-50 years old", "Subscribers", allowing you to filter these groups in your analytics reports.

= Can Scoby Analytics measure button clicks or mouse movements? =
No. To preserve visitor privacy, Scoby Analytics doesn’t access your visitors’ browsers. Such activities would require visitor consent.

= Can I use Scoby data in other reporting tools like Looker Studio or PowerBI? =
Yes. As an official Looker Studio Partner, we provide a Connector for integrating Scoby Analytics data into Looker Studio. Additionally, our Reporting Center supports .xlsx exports, making it compatible with PowerBI and Tableau.

= What will I see when using Scoby Analytics? =
With Scoby, you gain complete visibility of all page views. We guarantee to capture every page view, enabling 100% measurement of your website traffic - all without needing cookie consent.

= Do I need multiple tools (e.g., Google Analytics and Scoby) for a comprehensive view? =
Scoby Analytics anonymizes and measures all your website traffic, providing insights into overall movement patterns. However, individual user journeys aren't reported to ensure privacy. Depending on your needs, Scoby could be used as a standalone tool or in conjunction with others.

= What does the "Other" dimension in the Dashboard signify? =
The "Other" bucket is part of Scoby's unique privacy-preserving technology. We use a k-Anonymity of 25 for all analytical queries, meaning that results with less than 25 visitors are grouped into the "Other" bucket to ensure visitor privacy.
