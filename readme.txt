### LET'S GO OVER KEY FEATURES IN SCOBY ANALYTICS

Scoby Analytics helps you analyze your WordPress traffic in many ways. Let's take a look!

#### CAPTURE COMPLETE TRAFFIC INSIGHTS WITHOUT COMPROMISE

In the landscape of digital analytics, full visibility into your website's traffic and conversions is critical, especially when it pertains to paid sources where every click counts. Scoby Analytics excels in this area, capturing 100% of your WordPress site's paid traffic sources, traffic, and conversions, ensuring that you have a complete overview of your investment's performance.

Traditional analytics tools often require user consent to track this data, which can significantly reduce visibility, sometimes to as low as 40% of actual traffic. This consent-based blind spot can leave you with an incomplete picture of how well your paid campaigns are performing. Scoby Analytics bypasses the need for consent, maintaining full insight into your traffic and enabling you to measure the true effectiveness of your paid sources without any data being concealed by consent barriers. With Scoby Analytics, empower your strategy with the full spectrum of data and optimize your campaigns with confidence.

#### STAY ON TOP OF YOUR DATA WITH INNOVATIVE METRICS

Delve into metrics that matter with Scoby Analytics and unlock a deeper understanding of your audience's engagement. With Scoby Analytics, you gain access not only to the essential vanity metrics that provide a snapshot of your website's performance—visits, visitors, page views, and average time spent on site—but also to advanced analytics that offer deeper insights. Our platform goes beyond the basics to deliver a granular view of user engagement through the distribution of time spent. This innovative metric breaks down precisely what percentage of visitors spend various lengths of time on your site, providing a nuanced understanding of user behavior.

Moreover, Scoby Analytics brings you percentile-based reporting, a sophisticated analysis that outlines the time spent by visitors in a more detailed manner. By examining these percentiles, you can identify behavioral patterns, such as whether a majority of users engage with your content for a longer or shorter duration. This data is crucial for optimizing user experience and content strategy, as it reveals the depth of engagement and highlights areas for improvement. With Scoby Analytics, stay informed and make data-driven decisions to enhance your website's performance and user satisfaction.

#### UNBLOCKABLE ANALYTICS FOR UNCOMPROMISED DATA QUALITY

Navigate the ad-blocking wave with Scoby Analytics—your assurance of uninterrupted data collection. Ad blockers can significantly skew analytics by preventing tracking codes from capturing crucial user interaction data. However, Scoby Analytics offers a robust solution that is impervious to ad blockers. This ensures that your data quality remains pristine, and you retain complete visibility over your website's analytics.

With the rise of ad-blocking technology, traditional analytics tools often report a fraction of actual site activity, leading to incomplete insights and potentially misguided business decisions. Scoby Analytics, leveraging server-side tracking, circumvents these blockers with ease, guaranteeing that your analytics reflect 100% of site traffic, including all user behaviors and conversion pathways.

Invest in Scoby Analytics to ensure that your data isn’t just a subset of reality but a comprehensive reflection of every visitor interaction, unaffected by browser-based ad blockers. With this level of accuracy and reliability, you can fine-tune your marketing efforts and website experience based on complete and unaltered data.

#### POWERFUL INTEGRATION WITH OTHER TOOLS

Scoby Analytics isn't just a standalone solution; it's built to work harmoniously with your existing toolkit. With robust integration capabilities, it effortlessly connects with a wide array of platforms, including Looker Studio, PowerBI, and Tableau, enabling you to extend and enhance your data analysis. Whether you're looking to import your analytics into comprehensive reports, dashboards, or blend them with other data sources for richer insights, Scoby Analytics ensures that your website's performance metrics feed seamlessly into your workflow. This interoperability not only saves time but also enriches the decision-making process, ensuring that your analytical insights are always within reach, no matter where you need them.
